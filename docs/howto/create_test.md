# How to create a new Test

After [starting Horreum](/docs/tutorial/start.html) and logging in you'll find a blank table with **New Test** button above:

<div class="screenshot"><img src="/assets/images/create_test/01_logged_in.png" /></div>

All you need to fill in here is the test name. Test names must be unique within Horreum.

<div class="screenshot"><img src="/assets/images/create_test/02_new_test.png" /></div>

When you press the **Save** button on the bottom several other tabs appear on the top; you can go to **Access**. The test was created with **Private** access rights; if you want anonymous users to see your tests you can set it to **Public** and save the test.

<div class="screenshot"><img src="/assets/images/create_test/03_test_access.png" /></div>

When you're done you can navigate to **Tests** in the bar on the top of the screen and see that the test was really created:

<div class="screenshot"><img src="/assets/images/create_test/04_tests.png" /></div>

The test is there but in the Run Count column you don't see any runs. Now you can continue with [uploading data](./upload.html) into Horreum.
